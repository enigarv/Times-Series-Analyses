# Times-Series-Analyses
In this repository a generic time serie is analyzed in depth.

Initially the TS is analyzed graphically in order to understand its trend and possible patterns.
Later we study the **stationarity** of the time series through two statistical tests. The first test used is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test which confirms the hypothesis that the TS is stationary. The KPSS test also confirmed the stationarity hypothesis.

It follows that the time series is **stationary** and does not require differentiation.

## Forecast
We analyzed three different approaches to forecast a time series:
- ARIMA (and SARIMA)
- UCM
- Machine Learning
